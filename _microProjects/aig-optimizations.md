Description: State-of-the-art SMT solvers are strikingly efficient in solving logical constraints of various theories: from linear integer arithmetic to algebraic data types and quantifiers. They provide rich API used by researchers in numerous domains. However, symbolic execution demands only limited theories: quantifier-free theories of integer and double bit-vectors and arrays. The goal of this project is to investigate how SMT solvers can be tuned to achieve better performance for specific needs of symbolic execution engines.
