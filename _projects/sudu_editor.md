It is designed and implemented from scratch with focus on portability and performance
and with ability to run identically well from single codebase
-	on Desktop in pure JVM
-	and in WEB environment

**As a result** - it is easy and convenient to develop using fast desktop JVM, but targeting WEB

**Sudu Editor** is not based on any existent heavy frameworks like Chromium or Swing which means:
-	there is no need to merge upstream and there are no unexpected conflicts
-	it is easy portable to run on mobile platforms
