Prosody transfer is well-studied in the context of expressive speech synthesis. Cross-lingual prosody transfer, however, is challenging and has been under-explored to date. This task naturally emerges when one needs to translate an audio or video recording with expressive speech and preserve original voice and emotions. We study and propose novel solutions to learn prosody representations that are transferable across languages and speakers for machine dubbing of expressive multimedia contents. Multimedia contents often contain field recordings and thus require prosody transfer from noisy audios. Our goal is to propose a system that could generate speech with context-matching prosody with the same quality as a human voiceover artists.
