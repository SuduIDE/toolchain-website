We consider the problem of finding code snippets that operate identically but are written in different programming languages. We present a novel training procedure, called cross-consistency training (CCT), that we apply to train language models on source code in different programming languages. CCT allows to align code snippets in different programming languages, with new SotA results by CCT-LM on POJ-104 and XCD (our new dataset)
